# Q-Learning Enhanced Answer Selection with LLM

## Overview

This Python script integrates Q-learning with a Large Language Model (LLM) to select the best answers from those provided by the LLM. It demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning to improve answer selection in AI applications. The script is designed as a conceptual framework and requires customization for specific use cases.

## Features

- **Q-Learning Algorithm**: Implements the Q-learning algorithm to learn the selection of optimal answers over time.
- **LLM Integration**: Interacts with an LLM (like GPT-4) to fetch potential answers for given questions.
- **Answer Evaluation**: Evaluates answers based on relevance, completeness, and correctness.
- **Question Generation**: Generates or fetches questions for the LLM to answer.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed on your machine.
   - Install required Python packages: `requests` for API interactions.
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```

3. **API Keys**: Obtain necessary API keys for the LLM you intend to use and add them to the script.

## Usage

1. **Configuration**: Set up the script with the correct LLM API endpoint and your API key.

2. **Running the Script**: Run the script using Python.
   ```bash
   python q_learning_llm.py
